    <h2>Behavior</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>Communication</h3>
      <li>
        <p>Purring - means that the cat is either content or is self-soothing due to fear</p>
        <p>Meowing - a frequently used greeting. A mother meows when interacting with her young. Meows can also be used when a cat wishes for attention. </p>
        <p>Hissing or spitting - indicates an angry or defensive cat.</p>
        <p>Yowling - means that the cat is in distress or feeling aggressive.</p>
        <p>Chattering - occurs when hunting or tracking potential prey. This consists of quick chirps made while the mouth vibrates. The gaze is fixed and staring.
            This behavior may be in response to a surge of adrenaline or may be caused by the anticipation of a pending hunt.[3]</p>
      </li>
      <h4>Body Language</h4>
      <h5>Tail</h5>
      <p>Held high, may have a slight curl forward - a sign of friendliness. The cat is happy, content, and comfortable. The tail may quiver or vibrate if the cat is excited.</p>
      <p>Held low and tucked under - a sign of fear or unease. The cat is attempting to make itself a smaller target to potential threats.</p>
      <p>Flicking, twitching - a sign of agitation. The cat is on high alert or is upset, and is not receptive to interaction.
      Cats may also flick their tails in an oscillating, snake-like motion, or abruptly from side to side, often just before pouncing on an object or animal.</p>
